All of the code was done using Timescale to highlight how the platform was able to support these complex benchmarks with relative ease.</li> </ol> <p>Here are some writing samples from the instructor blog which we\u2019ve done</p> <ol> <li>Smarter Summaries w Finetuning GPT-3.5 and Chain Of Density - We were one of the first to show how fine-tuning GPT-3.5 could result in massive performance boosts for specific tasks. This post went viral and charted at #3 on Hackernews when we published it.</li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Bad Schemas Could break Your LLM Structured Outputs - This was a research style article where we highlighted the dangers of using JSON mode versus structured outputs through a series of benchmarks that we performed on GPT-4o and Claude models against the GSM8k</p> </li> <li> <p>RAG Is More Than Embeddings Search - This was an article we put out last year talking about the limitations of embedding search and why scaling beyond a simple demo requires careful and thoughtful consideration to metadata filters and query understanding. </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""}]}
